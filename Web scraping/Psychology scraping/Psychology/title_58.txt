Evolutionary Psychology
Men who suspect their female partners have more male friends produce ejaculates with higher sperm concentration—yet paradoxically, those who believe in their partner’s faithfulness generate sperm that move faster.
People with stronger upper bodies tend to have more sexual partners, and for men, more muscle might also mean a greater chance of a long-term relationship. A new study challenges assumptions about strength, sex, and evolution—with surprising findings for women.
Masculine-identifying lesbians have higher testosterone levels than feminine-identifying lesbians and heterosexual women, a new study finds. However, a commonly used marker of prenatal testosterone, finger length ratio, showed no differences between the groups, sparking further questions about hormones and sexuality.
A vast, 90-country study reveals romantic love is globally vital for long-term relationships, especially for women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and people in developed nations. This supports the idea that love evolved as a commitment tool for relationships.
A recent study found that genetic traits linked to higher education are being selected against, while traits tied to health and earlier reproduction are favored.
A recent study found that dependency-oriented help-seeking signals romantic interest, fostering attraction by promoting interdependence.
Researchers found that romantic cues increase men’s tendency to stick with prior investments, even in unrelated decisions, due to goal-focused thinking, while women are less influenced by such cues because of differing mating strategies.
A new study has found that areas with higher pathogen stress showed increased anti-Black bias, reflected in Google searches for racial slurs, but disease avoidance motivations only partly explained this link.
A recent study found that altruistic behavior is universally attractive in romantic partners, with no significant differences between heterosexual and homosexual individuals.
Recent research found that most women show unconscious attraction to other women, even though only a small percentage identify as non-heterosexual. This suggests a greater fluidity in women's sexual attraction than self-reported measures typically indicate.
Harsh financial and physical conditions generally reduce consumer desire for products, with variations by product type and gender. Toughness-signaling products retained male interest under physical stress, while wealth-signaling items showed decreased desirability.
Narcissism is associated with higher fertility, while psychopathy and Machiavellianism, linked to criminal behavior, are associated with lower fertility.
Conservatives in Europe have higher fertility rates than liberals, according to new research, leading to a growing proportion of conservative individuals over generations.
Women with heightened beliefs in a dangerous world recommend harsher minimum sentences for physically strong male defendants, highlighting how evolutionary threat detection biases can influence modern legal judgments.
A study highlights that harm toward women is perceived as more severe than harm toward men due to evolutionary, cognitive, and cultural factors. This bias minimizes male victimization, reinforces stereotypes, and perpetuates gender disparities in societal responses and legal systems.
