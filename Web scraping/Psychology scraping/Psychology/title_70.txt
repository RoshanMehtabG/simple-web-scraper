Anxiety
Children and adolescents with ADHD have significantly higher risks of depression and anxiety disorders. However, stimulant medications are linked to a 20% reduction in depression risk.
Teens who prefer digital communication over face-to-face interactions show higher social anxiety levels, with this link associated with brain activity patterns related to emotion regulation.
Physically active children, including those with autism or ADHD, exhibit significantly lower rates of anxiety and depression compared to their inactive peers.
A recent study found that the oVRcome app reduced social anxiety symptoms in six weeks, with sustained benefits. Its low-cost, self-guided VR approach improves accessibility, offering a scalable alternative for treating social anxiety disorder.
Estradiol helps reduce fear responses during extinction but causes a stronger return of fear later. Progesterone showed no effect on fear responses. These findings suggest estradiol levels may influence the success of anxiety therapies like exposure therapy.
A recent study used machine learning to identify key brain regions and networks, like the amygdala and default mode network, that differentiate people with small animal phobia, advancing understanding of its neurological basis.
A low-calorie, high-protein diet reduced anxiety and depression symptoms after 15 days and stress after 30 days in obese individuals, suggesting mental health benefits.
Hangxiety, or hangover anxiety, is the intense worry or dread some people feel after drinking alcohol. It stems from brain chemical imbalances, dehydration, or regret over actions while intoxicated, and is worsened by pre-existing anxiety or heavy drinking.
Male and female mice use different brain circuits to process threats, revealing sex-specific neural pathways despite similar behaviors. These findings suggest the need for sex-inclusive neuroscience research to improve understanding and treatments.
The general use of negative words in natural language are associated with elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety over time, regardless of individual mental health status.
Long-term exposure to residential greenness is associated with a reduced risk of depression and anxiety, as published in Nature Mental Health.
The psychedelic DOI reduces anxiety by activating specific interneurons in the ventral hippocampus without causing hallucinations, according to new research, suggesting potential for targeted anxiety treatments .
Left amygdala connections to brain networks regulating attention and social behavior are linked to children’s withdrawal, depression, and social problems, revealing distinct brain circuits for these internalizing behaviors.
A recent study found that people with Toxoplasma gondii antibodies had a higher risk of developing anxiety disorders, suggesting a potential link between the parasite and certain mental and neurological conditions.
Climate anxiety does not strongly relate to generalized anxiety or most health behaviors. This suggests climate anxiety may differ from generalized anxiety and doesn’t significantly impair health habits.
