Cognitive Science Research
Scientists have uncovered that strong brain circuits—particularly those behind language and arithmetic—may empower seniors to manage finances and fend off scams.
In moments of crisis, deep focus, or psychedelic exploration, seconds can morph into minutes. This isn't just memory playing tricks. "Time expansion experiences" reveal a profound link between consciousness and our perception of reality.
A nap, especially one that includes REM sleep, helps people solve problems they previously struggled with. Sleep enhances problem-solving by improving the ability to recognize hidden connections between related problems.
A recent study found that genetic traits linked to higher education are being selected against, while traits tied to health and earlier reproduction are favored.
Research found a weak positive link between anger and creative performance, stronger in Eastern cultures, recent studies, and imaginative or malevolent creativity, particularly when anger was experimentally induced rather than naturally occurring.
Teens with lower intelligence and emotional abilities are more likely to support authoritarian beliefs, whether left- or right-wing, suggesting shared psychological traits underpin rigid, authority-driven ideologies across the political spectrum.
A single exercise session can slightly boost cognitive performance, especially reaction times, with vigorous and high-intensity activities like cycling showing the strongest benefits.
Good readers exhibit distinct brain traits, including a larger left anterior temporal lobe and thicker left Heschl’s gyrus, supporting phonological and meaning processing. Reading reshapes these areas, highlighting the brain's adaptability and the importance of literacy.
Cognitive ability is primarily inherited through genes, with little influence from shared family environments, according to new research.
Ultrafast memory consolidation—brief moments of learning during breaks—works similarly in individuals with and without autism, showing that autistic traits do not disrupt rapid memory stabilization or learning processes.
Brain-training games lack solid evidence for improving cognition, but research shows engaging in new, challenging activities—like learning skills or playing effortful games—can enhance memory, processing speed, and brain efficiency.
Self-reports outperform implicit measures, according to a new review, offering greater reliability, predictive validity, and flexibility. The paper challenges beliefs about implicit tools’ robustness, unconscious content access, and superiority in studying automatic processes.
Recent research found that short, frequent cold-water immersions improved cognitive performance on specific tasks, reduced sleep disturbances, and lowered worry levels, without affecting overall well-being or selective attention.
Stress disrupts memory precision, causing generalized fear responses by enlarging memory-encoding neuron networks. This effect, mediated by the brain’s endocannabinoid system, suggests potential therapeutic targets for conditions like PTSD and anxiety disorders.
Students with high confidence, enjoyment, and recognition of science’s value, combined with low perceived effort, achieved the highest science scores and aspirations.
