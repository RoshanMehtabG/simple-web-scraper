New research highlights a potential mechanism behind intoxicated aggression.
A study found that levodopa-induced dyskinesia disconnects the motor cortex from movement control, allowing abnormal movements. Ketamine reduced these movements, restored some brain control, and altered neural interactions, showing promise as a potential treatment.
The use of diabetes drugs semaglutide and liraglutide was associated with fewer hospitalizations for alcohol use disorder compared to approved treatments, suggesting these medications may have potential benefits for managing alcohol-related health issues.
Recent research found that young adults at risk of psychosis have reduced brain connectivity, and cannabis use worsens this issue, potentially disrupting brain development and increasing vulnerability to psychotic disorders.
